# <Landing-Page>
## Description

This project was based on refactoring code to meet a certain standard and implement new technology. A marketing agency has asked we refactor their exsisting site to make it more accessible. Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. 
-Through out this project we learned what accessibility standards are, what semantic HTML elements are and their order as well as using alt attributes to maintain a clean and organized style of code.

## Installation
1st Using VS CODE, I ensured HTML and CSS were working properly on their landing website. 
2nd I refractored the code used on HTML and made it simply to read and noted the HTML for accessibility and easy understanding. 
3rd I double verfied page was running.
4th Project Complete. 
## Usage
  Modified code usage from non-semantic; example:
<div id="header"></div>
<div class="section">
	<div class="article">
		<div class="figure">
			<img>
			<div class="figcaption"></div>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
<div id="footer"></div>

To Semantic Elements in order:

<header></header>
<section>
	<article>
		<figure>
			<img>
			<figcaption></figcaption>
		</figure>
	</article>
</section>
<footer></footer>

By doing so we've managed to make their webpage easy to read, accessible and search engines and assistive technologies are also able to better understand the content of this website, overall creating a good experience for the users.
